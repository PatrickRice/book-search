# book-search

The Book Search App is a SPA (Single Page Application) which utilizes the full MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack to allow users to search for books by title.  Additionally, users have the option to save books from their search results to a reading list and MongoDB is used to manage back-end CRUD requirements for the reading list.

App Process Flow:

- The Google Books API is queried based on the user's search criteria and a list of results is returned with the option for the user to view a preview for each book they select and save books to their reading list (if a book returned by the API call is already saved to the user's reading list, the "Save" button is not rendered and instead a disabled button showing "Saved" is rendered).

- Since the search results generated by the API call are maintained in state on the "Search" page and react-router-dom is used to enable navigation, users are able to seamlessly move between their search results and their list of saved books.  State data needed outside of the "Search" page is passed to child components via props.

- To optimize application efficiency, the MongoDB database is only updated when a user requests to perform a CRUD action on thier list of saved books and React state is only updated when a user submits a new search title.

- React lifecycle mothods are used to refresh the DOM after a CRUD action is performed.

Technoligies utilized:
- React, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Javascript (JSX), react-router-dom NPM, mongoose NPM, Google Books API
